## What Is FinanceGPT?

FinanceGPT is a production-quality finance language model built from the ground up — every component is custom-built, including the neural network architecture, the tokenizer, and the multi-agent reasoning pipeline. It answers financial questions with structured, step-by-step reasoning grounded in a curated knowledge base of 1,200+ finance Q&A pairs across 31 domains.

The system is designed around a key insight: **retrieval + reasoning + generation beats generation alone.** Rather than relying solely on what the model memorised during training, every query passes through a 4-agent pipeline that retrieves relevant knowledge, detects and computes financial formulas, scaffolds chain-of-thought reasoning, and finally generates a grounded response.

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language Model | Decoder-only transformer (RoPE · RMSNorm · SwiGLU) |
| Tokenizer | Custom BPE trained from scratch on finance text |
| Knowledge Retrieval | TF-IDF cosine similarity over 1,200+ Q&A pairs |
| Reasoning | Rule-based CoT scaffold with 8-type question classifier |
| Agent Orchestration | `ThreadPoolExecutor` — parallel Phase 1 agents |
| Memory | JSON-backed conversation history, persistent across sessions |
| Hardware | CPU and CUDA (mixed precision via `torch.autocast`) |

## Example Conversation

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/example_sharpe.svg" alt="Example: Sharpe Ratio Calculation" width="80%"/>
</div>

```
  You ► What is the Sharpe ratio and calculate it for a fund
        with 15% return, 3% risk-free rate, and 10% volatility?

  ⟳ Agents thinking…

  FinanceGPT ►
  Calculated:
    Sharpe Ratio = (15% − 3%) / 10% = 1.2000

  The Sharpe ratio measures how much excess return you receive
  per unit of risk taken. Step 1: Calculate excess return above
  the risk-free rate: 15% − 3% = 12%. Step 2: Divide by the
  portfolio's standard deviation (volatility): 12% ÷ 10% = 1.2.
  Step 3: Interpret — a Sharpe ratio above 1.0 is considered good;
  1.2 indicates the fund earns 1.2% of excess return for every 1%
  of volatility it accepts. Therefore, this fund demonstrates solid
  risk-adjusted performance relative to a passive benchmark.

## Dataset — 31 Finance Domains

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/dataset_overview.svg" alt="Dataset Domain Overview" width="80%"/>
</div>

| Category | Domains |
|---|---|
| **Fundamentals** | Finance Fundamentals · Economics · Fundamental Analysis · Financial Ratios |
| **Markets** | Stock Market · Global Markets · Technical Analysis · Behavioral Finance |
| **Fixed Income** | Bonds & Fixed Income · Portfolio Theory |
| **Derivatives** | Options Trading · Quantitative Finance |
| **Strategies** | Investment Strategies · Hedge Funds · Risk Management |
| **Private Markets** | Private Equity · Startup & Entrepreneurship Finance |
| **Corporate** | Corporate Finance · Financial Modeling · Financial Crises |
| **Personal** | Personal Finance · Retirement Planning · Tax Strategies · Wealth Management |
| **Alternative** | Real Estate Investing · Commodities Trading · Forex Trading · Cryptocurrency |
| **Modern Finance** | Fintech & Blockchain · ESG & Sustainable Finance · Banking & Finance |

All Q&A pairs use **chain-of-thought answer format**:

```
"What is X?","To understand X, let's break it down:
Step 1: ...
Step 2: ...
Therefore, ..."
```

This trains the model to reason through problems rather than pattern-match to memorised surface answers.

## Reasoning System — Deep Dive

Every query passes through four stages, regardless of complexity.

### Stage 1 — Knowledge Retrieval

`KnowledgeAgent` performs TF-IDF cosine similarity search across all 1,200+ Q&A pairs and returns the top-6 most semantically relevant passages. This gives the model factual grounding even for questions outside its direct training distribution.

### Stage 2 — Financial Calculation

`CalculationAgent` scans the query for numeric inputs and formula keywords. If a supported formula is detected, it computes the answer directly and prepends it to the response — guaranteeing mathematical accuracy regardless of model output.

**Supported formulas:**

| Formula | Keywords Detected |
|---|---|
| Sharpe Ratio | `sharpe`, `risk-adjusted` |
| Compound Interest | `compound interest`, `compound`, `compounded` |
| Simple ROI | `roi`, `return on investment` |
| Present Value | `present value`, `pv`, `discount` |
| EV/EBITDA | `ev/ebitda`, `enterprise value` |

### Stage 3 — Reasoning Scaffold

`ReasoningAgent` classifies the query into one of 8 types and applies a matching chain-of-thought template:

| Type | Trigger Words | Scaffold Structure |
|---|---|---|
| `calculation` | calculate · compute · how much | Identify inputs → Apply formula → Interpret result |
| `definition` | what is · explain · define | Core meaning → Key components → Real-world example |
| `comparison` | compare · vs · difference between | Option A → Option B → When to use each |
| `causal` | why · because · what causes | Mechanism → Driving factors → Implications |
| `strategy` | should I · best way · recommend | Understand goals → Evaluate options → Risk considerations |
| `process` | how does · how to · steps to | Prerequisites → Execution → Expected outcome |
| `historical` | what happened · crisis · history of | Events → Causes → Lessons learned |
| `risk` | risk · hedge · protect · exposure | Identify → Quantify → Mitigate |

### Stage 4 — Generation

`ModelAgent` passes the full enriched context to the FinanceGPT transformer:

```
[conversation history] + [top-6 retrieved passages] + [CoT scaffold] + [computed result if any]
→ transformer generates grounded, structured response
```

---

## Training Plots

Four training plots are saved automatically to `training_plots/` after each run:

| Plot | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| `01_training_loss.png` | Raw step loss + smoothed curve + validation loss overlay |
| `02_perplexity.png` | Model perplexity over training steps |
| `03_train_vs_val.png` | Train vs. validation loss per epoch (overfitting diagnostic) |
| `04_learning_rate.png` | Cosine annealing LR schedule with warmup |

---

## Configuration

All hyperparameters live in `config.py` — the single source of truth.

```python
MODEL_CONFIG = {
    "d_model": 384,       # Embedding dimension
    "n_heads": 8,         # Attention heads
    "n_layers": 8,        # Transformer blocks
    "d_ff": 1536,         # FFN inner dim (4× d_model)
    "max_seq_len": 512,   # Context window (tokens)
    "dropout": 0.10,
}

TRAIN_CONFIG = {
    "epochs": 15,
    "batch_size": 16,
    "grad_accum": 4,      # Effective batch = 64
    "lr": 2e-4,
    "patience": 4,        # Early stopping patience
    "mixed_precision": True,
}

GEN_CONFIG = {
    "temperature": 0.82,        # Higher = more creative (0.5–1.0)
    "top_k": 50,
    "top_p": 0.92,
    "repetition_penalty": 1.3,  # Higher = less repetition
    "max_new_tokens": 220,
}
```

---

## Extending the Knowledge Base

Adding a new finance topic takes under 5 minutes:

**1. Create a CSV in `data/` with `question,answer` columns:**

```csv
question,answer
"What is X?","To understand X: Step 1: ... Step 2: ... Therefore, ..."
```

**2. Retrain:**

```bash
python main.py /train
```

The BPE tokenizer automatically extends its vocabulary to cover new terminology. The knowledge base reindexes on next chat startup. No code changes required.

## Debugging

**If the model gives a bad or incomplete answer:**

```bash
python main.py /chat
# Ask the question, then run:
/agents
```

The `/agents` output will tell you:

| Signal | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| KB returned 0 docs | Topic not in any CSV | Add a CSV row for this topic and retrain |
| KB score < 0.1 | Query wording doesn't match training data | Rephrase, or add more varied questions to CSV |
| Question type misclassified | Trigger words not in query | Check `reasoning_engine.py` classifier rules |
| Model output is empty | Context window overflow | Reduce `max_new_tokens` or conversation length |
| Answer cuts off mid-sentence | `max_new_tokens` too low | Increase `GEN_CONFIG["max_new_tokens"]` in `config.py` |
